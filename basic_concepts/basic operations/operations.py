# we can write operation in python console directly, like: >>> 2-6

print(2 + 6)

print(8 / 4) # will results float number

print(8 / 5) # will results float number 

# summation and multiplication of 2 integers will result integers.
print(2 + 5)
print(2 * 8)

# division will always results in float.
print(3/4)


# Computers can't store floats perfectly accurately, in the same way 
# that we can't write down the complete decimal expansion of 
# 1/3 (0.3333333333333333...). because it often leads to infuriating bugs!
print(1 / 3)



# we can also convert integers to floats, 
print(float(5))

# or floats to integers 
print(int(5.6))
